- shows free space on filesystem
- add bookmarks to the sidebar
- share files from app
- ad free
- open source

## Usage

### Permissions

Obviously this app needs full access to the filesystem to work. This is checked and prompted if needed when starting the app.
The app also needs internet access to check for updates if this feature is enabled in the settings.
